Should we standardize comments? One possible style:

Separate-line comment with whitespace, singular verb, and uppercase 1st character.

'''
// Parses user input...
Command command = addressBookParser.parseCommand(commandText);
'''

Same-line comment with whitespace, singular verb, and lowercase 1st character.

I know this is a bit late, but do you think we should change `AddPersonCommand` to `AddPatientCommand`?

I think our `Person` refers specifically to `Patient` since we have the `periodOfStay` field. If we are adding a `Staff` class in the future, it may be a little misleading since `Staff` is a `Person` too.

What do you think?

Since we are using `Patient` now, maybe we can rename some of these variables? 

Perhaps from `MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX` to `MESSAGE_INVALID_PATIENT_DISPLAYED_NAME`.

Also, do you think we should change our usage of "person" to "patient"? 🤔

 i.e. "The **patient** name..." instead.

For separate-line comments, do you think we should keep the first character in uppercase?

to fix this issue (change Clients to client), refer to the new comment

From what I found out: 
- The program uses the "Clients" variable as keyword to save a json file. 
- The program then uses @JsonProperty("clients") to pick this keyword for assignment from the json file

Yes. I expect it to have more errors. 
Because, the actual data file is saved as caps Client instead of client.

I can only help u find these (those files in /JsonAddressBookStorageTest & /JsonSeralizedAddressBookTest) files, that you might be likely to change them from caps C to small C. Maybe there are others that are not flagged out

I'm not sure if `<ins>` is the correct tag to use here? (And the closing tag should be `</ins>` right) From what I gathered online `<ins>` is to underline some text in html to indicate it is an insertion, but there's not `<del>` tag here, so I think it might be more appropriate to use either the `<u>` tag for underlining or `[]()` syntax if its supposed to be a link

yes, it is designed to modify its input arguments. this wouldn't be necessary if java had some semblance of decent features after 14 versions, like pattern matching;

this is how i use bisect in a proper language:
'''cpp
std::string_view x;
std::string_view xs;

std::tie(x, xs) = util::bisect(input, ' ');
if(x.empty()) return { };

if(x[0] == '@')
{
	parse_tags(msg, x);
	std::tie(x, xs) = util::bisect(xs, ' ');
}

if(x[0] == ':')
{
	parse_prefix(msg, x);
	std::tie(x, xs) = util::bisect(xs, ' ');
}
'''

unfortunately this can't be done in java (there's no 'std::tie' equivalent, nor can there ever be). rather than introduce loads of syntactic noise by needing to (a) declare a pair to store the bisectionr result; (b) declare or assign a variable for the first part; (c) declare or assign a variable for the second part, it is more convenient this way.

besides, 'bisect()' clearly documents its mutating behaviour.

@AY2021S1-CS2103-T16-3/developers , @mkeoliya and I had a long discussion on how this value adds to our users. We weren't really able to find a concrete use case for this feature. Can anyone think of why this would be useful for our target users? We're leaning towards lowering the priority of (or even scrapping altogether) this User Story.

OTOH, we further refined our concept of the export feature, which we're documenting in #52 .

The Timer class is only used to keep track of the active timers. Once the timer is stopped, the data is stored under a WorkDuration class (which has not reference to project), and put in a list inside the corresponding project.

I implemented it this way because I didn't want to store incomplete timers in a project, since it might cause problems if the timer wasn't stopped properly. Its also easier to check for active timers this way (see activeTimer in ModelManager)

And i think it would be easier to extend to having multiple concurrent timers if we decide to do that (then each timer needs to know which project its keeping track of)

Just storing the index won't work because the filtered list might change while the timer is running.

This is mostly what i was referring to when i said more/better tests are needed.

Basically, since I'm using LocalDateTime.now() to get the current time, 2 times will never be exactly the same (they will be some nanoseconds apart). For example in tests, even if I start 2 timers immediately after one another, they will have different values, so equals() will still say that they're different. Since the existing tests involve checking if 2 models are equal, this will break a bunch of existing tests.

I'm think of either (a) Overloading the timer functions so that I can start them at a fixed time (just for testing) or (b) Introduce a custom global clock for the application to run on. The global clock will be the same as system clock in production, but in testing it will have functions that allow us to manually control the time.

A user will never see this message (as of now) since we don't require users to manually input times. If we add commands that involve time inputs, then it might be better to not use ISO8601 format in the first place (its hard to read) and instead use some variation of the "yyyy MM dd hh:mm:ss" style.

This error only come up in logs when theres an error in loading saved data (e.g. the saved data is not in ISO format). For now I'll add an example of what the format looks like to the error message

> For the Leader Object, you want to make it an instance of a Person? Such that it can contain email, address etc. I have included that in my implementation of Teammate. Lemme change that to Person then maybe your Leader can be an instance of Person too. This way you dun have to create email classes etc for the Leader

## Issues
### Format
When creating an issue, try to specify the part of the project the issue is meant to be working on by using square brackets in the title. If the issue does not specify anything, it is assumed to be implementation-based, i.e., related to modifying AB3/VirusTracker code. 

Example: `[DG] Add UC01 and UC02` indicates that this issue works on adding user cases 01 and 02 to the developer guide.

### Labeling
**Mandatory label**:
 * `priority.*` Indicates the priority level of the task. Has three levels, low, medium and high.

Apart from the mandatory priority label, you may include other labels to make it easier to search and locate issues. Feel free to add any labels, but please _**ensure no similar label already exists**_.

## Pull Requests

General note: PRs can only be merged only when two or more other people have reviewed and approved of the merge.

### Format for PR 
When creating the PR, please state which issues the PR closes on the last line of the description.

**Commit message:** 'keyword #xx, keyword #yy, keyword #zz' for multiple issues
* 'keyword' refers to any one of the following three words, 'close', 'fix', 'resolve'.
   * Using these keywords will cause the issue to be automatically closed once the PR is merged successfully.
   * _Note: Other tenses for the above words could be used as well, such as 'closes' or 'closed', but let us standardise using the 
     imperative form of the words above._
* '#xx' references the issue number, where xx is the number. For example, xx = 10 will reference issue number 10.

 Example: xx = 30
'''
...PR description here

Close #xx
''' 
The above will close issue 30 upon the successful merging of the PR. 
_The actual form of #xx is not used in this comment as it would reference actual issues. Please refer to the PRs page for more examples._

Added a skeleton to Duong's PR. Should be able to add on from there while avoiding merge conflicts.

(related note: can someone approve that PR? don't think I can do it because I also contributed a commit.)

We should use the same format as the one from AB3 (copied over below).

**Use case: Delete food**

**MSS**

1.  User requests to list persons
2.  AddressBook shows a list of persons
3.  User requests to delete a specific person in the list
4.  AddressBook deletes the person

    Use case ends.

**Extensions**

* 2a. The list is empty.

  Use case ends.

* 3a. The given index is invalid.

    * 3a1. AddressBook shows an error message.

      Use case resumes at step 2.

Seems like a github actions issue. This happens from time to time.

Closing and reopening the PR should restart the CI process (hopefully fixing this).

Hey Jin Hao, thank you so much for pointing out the error!

I've been meaning to consult the team prior to seeing your comment. The links you provided were really helpful to the resolution of the test errors I encountered. Alternatively, I have updated the settings in my IntelliJ to resolve the issue. You can check out the following link for the alternative strategy I employed.

For the Leader Object, you want to make it an instance of a Person? Such that it can contain email, address etc. I have included that in my implementation of Teammate. Lemme change that to Person then maybe your Leader can be an instance of Person too. This way you dun have to create email classes etc for the Leader
